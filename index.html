        <ul>
          <li><strong>Period</strong>- the beging of life</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Growp-up</strong> 
                         the great period in life is when we grow-up,  we learn, and we can fail  
                         and lives every kind of thing in life but we go ahead 
          </li
          <li>
            <strong>Opportinuty</strong>
                          As everyone in this world we've an chance to get  something and even to upgrade our 
                         life different way, but some of us let it down and decide to move ahead...
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Notion</strong> 
                         The meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of,
                         <br>and scientific inquiries about existence, social ties, consciousness,</br> and happiness.
          </li>
           <li>
            <strong>God time in life</strong> 
                         The traditional view has been that God is timeless in the sense of being outside time altogether; that is, 
                         he exists but does not exist at any point in time and he does not experience temporal succession
          </li>
           <li>
            <strong>Resolution time</strong>
                         "My times are in Your hands ..." Psalm 31:15. At the right time, God will provide your need. At the right time, 
                                                         God will deliver you. At the right time, God will rescue you.
                                                         With faith no mountain is unmovarable.
          </li>
             <strong>Conception </strong>
                        As the bible say "My times are in Your hands ..." Psalm 31:15. At the right time, God will provide your need. At the right time, 
                                                         God will deliver you. At the right time, God will rescue you
                   Life is the consciousness of humanity; it is perception of the world and the universe. So life is sadness; life is death. 
                   Life is suffering and destruction. But life is also happiness; life is living Life is joy and creativity
          </li>
                                                         
         
          <li>
            <strong>The true conclusion of life meaning</strong> 
            No one can tell the actual definition of the meaning of life. 
            For some, it is all about happiness, building a family, 
            and leading life as it is. For some, 
            it is about accumulating wealth, whereas, for some, it is all about love
